this is a new test page with many things to do ..-_- 
apparently not as its been a long time since trying out Antergos and Arch Linux so hence certain changes will be made to this repo as
 `sudo apt-get install package`
 isn't going to work on Arch and I'm too lazy to configure everything again. Hence will be updating a new script for Antergos and Arch Linux.
